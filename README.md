# first-project
I am learning my way around github. This could be very beneficial.
I really do not know what I am doing. 
I just want to write my code the way I am lerning in class.
I am so new to programming. 
I feel like the schooling is a waste on top of me needing to commit more time that I really do not have.
I will conmtinue to play around with github until something sinks in my brain.
